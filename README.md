# Real Estate Web Scrapping Analysis
This includes the final project I worked on during the master's program.
Some of the activies carried out where:
- Create a spider for web scrapping.
- Preprocess the data extracted.
- Statistical Analysis.
Machine Learning models:
- Unsupervised: Clustering.
- Supervised: Linear Regression, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
- Comparative evaluation of results.

The idea was to learn more about the real estate market in a city that might be of interest to you, either to live in or as an investment.
It's possible to define groups of properties with similar characteristics and predict the price of a new property.

It uses the city of Mazatlan as an example to obtain the data but it can be any other city with some simple changes.
